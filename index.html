                My Life Story â€“ Divine Osagada

   My name is Divine Osagada. I was born on October 24, 2007, in Delta State, Warri. I come from a wonderful family with three siblings: Russell, Fernandez, and Clover. My life has been a journey of learning, growth, and self-discovery, shaped by my experiences in school, family, and my passion for technology.

I spent my early childhood in Warri as well, surrounded by a loving family. As a child, I was curious and full of energy, always eager to explore the world around me. My educational journey began at Word of Faith, where I attended kindergarten. Those were fun and exciting years, filled with play, learning, and making my first friends. I was always fascinated by gadgets and enjoyed taking things apart to see how they worked, though i destroyed serval house hold appliances in the process.

After kindergarten, I joined Adonai Royal School for my primary education. School was an exciting time for me because my love for technology grew more and more. My favorite subjects included Basic science and vocational aptitude, and I was always eager to participate in school activities such as sports, jet-club and science fairs. I made great friends, some of whom I am still close to today. My teachers played a significant role in shaping my curiosity and confidence.
I loved playing games, watching cartoons, and spending time trying to build one thing or the other. These years were full of joyful memories, from school competitions to holidays with family.

Transitioning to secondary school at Adonai Royal School was a major step in my academic journey. The subjects became more challenging, but I pushed through, My dad got me a private tutor so I'd be able to do better in me studies and exams, i developed a strong interest in Computing and technological advancements, realizing how much I enjoyed working with technology. I participated in various school activities, including tech clubs, innovations, and sports.

During these years, I learned a lot about responsibility, discipline, and time management. I faced a lot of struggles, such as balancing schoolwork and personal interests, but I always found ways to push through. My family were a great source of support no matter how many times i fumbled.

In late 2024, I achieved a major milestone by gaining admission to Babcock University to study Computer Engineering. As a 100-level student, I am experiencing a whole new world of learning, independence, and growth. University life is exciting yet demanding, requiring me to manage my time wisely and stay focused on my goals.

I have made new friends, started working on projects that align with my passion. I am constantly learning new programming languages, exploring robotics, and staying updated on the latest technological advancements.

Looking back, I can see how much I have grown from childhood to now. Life has taught me resilience, patience, and the importance of perseverance and Great lessons. My dream is to become a successful Computer Engineer, working on innovative projects that will contribute to society.

In the next 4-years, I see myself graduating with excellent grades, gaining experience in the tech industry, and possibly starting my own tech company. My goal is to use technology to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.

This journey is just beginning, and I am excited for what the future holds!
